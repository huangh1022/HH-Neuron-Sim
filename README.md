# HH-Neuron-Sim
Simulation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model of current flow and channel openings in axons.

Application.py GUI contains options for editing the parameters of the simulation, such as timescale, applied voltage and current, HH parameters, etc.

HH parameters for giant squid axon taken from:
